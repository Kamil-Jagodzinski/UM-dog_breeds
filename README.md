# UM-dog_breeds 
The aim of the project is to prepare a convolutional neural network model for the classification of dog breeds (120 breeds).
Main algorithm is placed in file algorithm.ipynb.

## Datasets
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset?datasetId=119698&sortBy=commentCount&searchQuery=torch

## Run
- Download and unzip mentioned datasets.
-  Run each cell of jupyter file `preproc_data.ipynb`
- 1st - change dir names to breeds names
- 2nd - merge both dataset 
- 3rd - split new dataset to train, validation and test sets
- 4th - create new labels

## Used technologies:
- python3,
- jupyter, 
- pytorch,
- pandas,
